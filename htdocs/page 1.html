                <h2><i>Nanay</i></h2>
                <h3>Rosana Montenegro Abagon</h3>
                Mother. The light and leader of our home. She is a mathematics teacher and currently studying 
                for her doctorate degree in Math. An insipiration, an archetype of rags to riches, we admire 
                her the most because of how she sees life and overcomes challenges.

                <h3>Benny Garcenila Abagon</h3>
                A stoic and succinct man. He may look very serious every time but he is a soft and loving father 
                ready to provide us with all of our needs. A devoted member of the PDRRMO rescue team, he is also a 
                sideline car-dealer.

                <h3>Karl Benedict Montenegro Abagon</h3>
                This 17-year old is the oldest among the children. He is not really brotherly but if ever one of his siblings is in danger,
                 he will not waste a second thinking to save them. A father figure to us when our parents are not around.
                  A great cook, great singer, and great guitarist.

                <h3>Krysthea Charizze Montenegro Abagon</h3>
                The achiever of the family. Currently living away from her home to achieve steps closer to her dream 
                of being a doctor. She is the carbon copy of her mother's mind, nerdy and a leader.

                <h3>Karla Louella Montenegro Abagon</h3>
                The joker of the family. Despite the streotype of the middle child being always left out, she is the spotlight. 
                With her never-ending pranks, stomach-hurting jokes, and tiktok reenactments, you will never get bored with her presence.

                <h2>Ken-Ken</h2>
                <h3>Knight Emmanuel Montenegro Abagon</h3>
                The favorite of everyone in the family. This boy is the sweetest of all. An errand boy who never complains 
                but only if he gets to play his favorite online game at least 3 hours a day. He's gonna get glasses soon.
