                We love food. We often go out as a family to eat foods we crave. We love seafood, pork, beef, anything. 
                Anywhere we travel to, food is a must to try. We believe that good food means good soul that is why we 
                celebrate and just spend time with lots of food.

            <h1>House==Home</h1>
            <p>
                We used to live in a house that looked 1000% different from where we live now. It was a regular house 
                with two bedrooms. Me and my family, we all share one room together. Now we rose from our situation, 
                and we now live in our own humble abode.

            <h1>Celebration Tradition</h1>
            <p>
                Some families do the modern kind of celebrating which is going out and doing activities they enjoy. 
                Our celebration language on the other hand, is gathering for food. Birthdays, anniversaries, house 
                blessing, or during Christmas eve, we gather with our families and friends to eat.

            <h1>Sunday Habit</h1>
            <p>
                We are a religious family. As much as possible we try to go to church every Sunday even though we 
                are busy. We have always found strength with connecting to God and it might also be the reason for 
                our familyâ€™s success.
