                <h1>To Lolo Lito</h1>
                Even though I have never met you and probably never will, but I know you would be a cool grandfather. 
                Based on what my cousins have said, you would make them toys out of bamboo or cook them their your 
                signature dish. Many relatives from my mom’s side think we look a lot similar. I have the sharp jaw 
                that you have only if I could also see the similarity but even a picture of you, I have never seen.

            <div id="d2">
                <h1>To Lola Angela</h1>
                I may have not exchanged a word with you, or steal a glance from you because you left too early but one 
                thing I know is that you would love us the most. I know that because my mom was the dearest to your heart.
                 I wish I could’ve met you and saw how beautiful of a woman you were like my mom always describes.
            </div>
            <div id="d3">
                <h1>To Lola Lucy</h1>
                Your words never fail to inspire me. They say wisdom comes with age and I can surely testify for that. 
                If you wouldn’t have answered that phone call and came to talk to me, I would have been in depression upto today.
            </div>
            <div id="d4">
                <h1>To Lolo Carling</h1>
                Me and my siblings aren’t probably your favorite but know that I love you. I will never break the promise I 
                gave when I was in 3rd grade. You will be attending my med school graduation. That is still a long time ahead 
                but I know you will and you can. You are one of the strongest people I know.

            This video I chose to embed on this page reflects my love for my grandparents, may it be from my mother’s 
            side or my father’s. For my mom’s parents, this would serve as my message to them. I haven’t see them in 
            real life when I was born but I know that I could never forget to be grateful for them. My life would have 
            never been if it wasn’t for them raising my mom into a such responsible and empowering woman. They are loved 
            and will always be remembered. To my grandparents from my father’s side, I know that they know I will never 
            forget about them when I am away. Now that I live in another province, I never fail to express how much I
             miss them and would like to see them whenever I come home.
